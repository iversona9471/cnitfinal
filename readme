Create Loopback:
When the command 'create loopback' is issued to the bot, the bot will run a process to create loopback interface 69 with a IPv4 address of 69.69.69.69 
with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 on the destination router.

Monitoring:
When the command 'monitor vpns' is issued to the bot, the bot will run a process that checks the VPN status every 5 seconds. If the VPN status goes Down,
it will pull the new IP address from CSR2 and apply it to CSR1.
